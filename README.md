## Description ‚ùî‚ùì

In this project in first part I will try to detecting and tracking football players on video. 
When result will be satisfying I will try to map players position on the pitch in to 2D pitch image, thanks to whitch I will be able to analyse strategy of both teams
and players movement in each actions.


## Dataset and auxiliary materials üìÅ

When creating this project, in few case I used the solution presented at the following link:

[Football players tracking with YOLOv5 + ByteTrack](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-track-football-players.ipynb?ref=blog.roboflow.com)

Dataset whitch I used to train YOLOv8 model:

[DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/data)

## Model training 

In this part I use YOLOv8 and ByteTrack to detecting and tracing players. 

Training results you can find here : 

[Football_Objects_Detections_Training_model](https://github.com/DenyT17/Football_Object_Detection/blob/main/Football_Objects_Detections_Training_model.ipynb)

** This model will be changed ** 

Testing results you can find here : 

[Football_Objects_Detections_Testing](https://github.com/DenyT17/Football_Object_Detection/blob/main/Football_Object_Detection_Testing.ipynb)

In this part I added funcionality like: 
- Detecting players, ball, referees and goalkeeper,
- Identification of the player in possession of the species,
- Tracking players and ball.

I also created functions, thanks to which I can to use this functionality on single image or video.



## Next goals üèÜ‚åõ

* Train new model based on image with class like: 
  - Team 1
  - Team 2
  - Referees
  - Ball
  - Goalkeeper

*  Mapping player position to 2D pitch image
